# EP4130

       Sincere thanks to Dr. Shantanu Desai For his extensive guidance and research

## Description
This repository is a "starters kit" of useful statistical tools needed for analysis of data. 
It will discuss usage of statistics in Astronomy and Particle Physics and what tools are need to tackle problems in the above fields. 
However, the same statistical techniques are used in all branches of Physics and Engineering. 
The assignments are written in python however they can be done in any programming language. 
<!---
%This course will mainly provide cheatsheets and hands-on skills in solving day to day statistics problems. 
%No proofs will be discussed. Most of the example codes we shall refer to can be downloaded from http://www.astroml.org
-->
<!---
All this should be 
commented out

Other useful books (as reference)

Numerical Recipes 2nd edition, by Press et al (de-facto reference for many years to astrophysicists and particle physicists especially in frequentist analysis)
Python Data Science handbook by Jake Van Der Plas (very useful introduction to Python based data analysis. Came out in 2019)

##### Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences, by P.R. Bevington (somewhat elementary, but everyone should be familiar with this)

Practical Statistics for Astronomers J.V. Wall and C.R. Jenkins (See http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/jvw/ASTROSTATS/) (somewhat advanced and specialized)

Statistical Data Analysis by Glenn Cowan (for particle physicists)

Statistics for Nuclear and Particle Physicists by Louis Lyons

Statistics by R. J. Barlow

Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial by D. Sivia and John Skilling (a must read for Bayesian aficionados. somewhat advanced for this course)

Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy with R applications by Eric Feigelson and G.J. Babu (R based)
